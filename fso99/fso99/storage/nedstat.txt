Dear Mystery6,

Thank you for registering with NedStat. This e-mail message 
contains all the information you need to activate the NedStat 
counter. Follow these instructions very carefully ..... let 
the counting commence!

STEP 1. CHECK THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE GIVEN US.

 - Title of the page: The Federation Sim Organization
 - URL of the page on which the counter will be placed: http://members.xoom.com/FSO99/index.html
 - Owner: Mystery6 (mystery6@startrekmail.com)
 - Counter made at 21:19, from host 204.170.16.145
 - Category: Hobbies / Games

If this information is incorrect or incomplete, or if the URL of the
counter is incorrect, then change it on the NedStat User page.
(http://usa.nedstat.net/change.html)

VERY IMPORTANT: If you want to change something with the counter later
on you will need to do this using the users' page. The counter name
you then need is FSO99, and the password kalmar510. So KEEP THIS
E-MAIL IN A SAFE PLACE!

If the information is correct and complete, then proceed to step 2.

STEP 2. PUT THE HTML-CODE ON THE PAGE WHICH IS TO BE COUNTED.

Between the lines below you can find the HTML code which has to be
included in the HTML page to be measured. Don't change this code and
place it in the HTML file which can be found at http://members.xoom.com/FSO99/index.html.

-----
<!-- start of NedStat code -->
<a href="http://usa.nedstat.net/cgi-bin/viewstat?name=FSO99">
<img src="http://usa.nedstat.net/cgi-bin/nedstat.gif?name=FSO99" border=0 alt="" width=22 height=22></a>
<!-- end of NedStat code -->
-----

If you have an HTML-aware browser, you may see an icon instead of
HTML-code above. If and only if this is the case, please use this code instead:

-----
&lt;!-- start of NedStat code --&gt;
&lt;a href="http://usa.nedstat.net/cgi-bin/viewstat?name=FSO99"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://usa.nedstat.net/cgi-bin/nedstat.gif?name=FSO99" border=0 alt="" width=22 height=22&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- end of NedStat code --&gt;
-----

PLEASE NOTE: The HTML-code ensures that the NedStat icon appears 
visible and clickable on the page. This icon is downloaded from the 
NedStat server. Each time this happens, a visitor is counted.

Because of this, it is necessary that you copy the code exactly.
Please use 'copy and paste' to do this. If you type it in, make
sure you do it accurately. Don't leave out the with and height tags.

If you have any questions or problems with the use of the counter,
please check the 'Frequently Asked Questions' page at NedStat USA:

  http://usa.nedstat.net/faq.html

If this page does not answer your question, please contact the 
NedStat Service Department at info@nedstat.nl.

Enjoy your counter!
