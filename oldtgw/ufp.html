<P>Welcome to the UFP Headquarters! The HQ of the Federation and
StarfleetCommand are located on the planet Earth in the Sol system. The
Federation is currently in a war with the Klingon Empire, once a close allie,
and the Romulan Star Empire. The year is now 2385, 7 years after the Dominion
War ended. For a time after the Alpha Quadrent stood in unity and peace. Now it
is in a war for the fittest, a combat in wich only the strong shall survive. It
is now, as always has been, the Federations job to bring peace to this area of
space, now more than ever. The only way to bring peace once again thoguh is to
rid this space of the Klingon Empire and the Romulans.</P>
<P>New and improved ships are gearing for battle as we speak, the lead war
vessel being our own USS-Mossimo. New vessels are designed all the time to help
us defend our space, like the USS-Prometheus with a tri-agular attack vector,
the USS-Defiant, and the Soverign class ship{like the Mossimo}. With all this we
are sure to surface victorius. The Federation is truley destine to survive the
galactic War and bring peace once again to this quadrent! Join the Federation in
this fight for control of the Alpha and Beta Quadrents!</P><BR><BR>
