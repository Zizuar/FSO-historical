    <TD vAlign=top align=left>The year is 2385, and the Dominion war has
      ended. Seven years ago the combined forces of the Federation, Klingon
      Empire, and Romulan Star League defeated the Dominion, destroying all but
      a small amount the Cardassian species in the process. Finally, the Alpha
      Quadrant was at peace.....<BR><BR>But, as is always true, this peace could
      not last. After a few months bickering began between to Klingons and
      Romulans about just how much of the now empty space would be who's. The
      bickering was just that, for a year or two, but by 2382 it had become an
      all out war.<BR><BR>The Federation, allied with both, chose not to get
      involved. This lack of action proved to work in the opposite way of what
      the Federation had hoped. In 2384 both the Romulans and Klingons declared
      war on the Federation as well as each other, and as a response the
      Federation declared war on them.<BR><BR>And now the great battle has
      begun, the Federation led by President Felton, the Klingons lead by
      Chancellor Bowmak, and the Romulans led by Praetor Serena. The three super
      powers of the Alpha Quadrant clash in a Galactic War the likes never
      before seen...<BR><BR><A
