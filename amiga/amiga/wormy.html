<FONT COLOR="ORANGE">HISTORY :</FONT> 

	I was Born and Raised on DS4 and have piloted shuttles and  small craft since I was 14, as well as help with some of the Station's systems.  Being that far out there were often shortages of engineers.  This early experience with shuttles, computers, and other systems helped me become a skilled pilot as well as an engineer, even before I entered the academy.  My early experience helped me at the academy and I graduated 8th in my class.
