    <TD>The year is 2385, and the Dominion war has ended. Seven years ago the
      combined forces of the Federation, Klingon Empire, and Romulan Star League
      defeated the Dominion, destroying all but a small amount the Cardassian
      species in the process. Finally, the Alpha Quadrant was at
      peace.....<BR><BR>But, as is always true, this peace could not last. After
      a few months bickering began between to Klingons and Romulans about just
      how much of the now empty space would be who's. The bickering was just
      that, for a year or two, but by 2382 it had become an all out
      war.<BR><BR>The Federation, allied with both, chose not to get involved.
      This lack of action proved to work in the opposite way of what the
      Federation had hoped. In 2384 both the Romulans and Klingons declared war
      on the Federation as well as each other, and as a response the Federation
      declared war on them.<BR><BR>And now the great battle has begun, the
      Federation led by President Jonathan Khurgee, the Klingons lead by
      Chancellor Kha'Rak Kyrros, and the Romulans led by Fvillha Serena. The
      three super powers of the Alpha Quadrant clash in a Galactic War the likes
      never before
seen...<BR><BR><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
