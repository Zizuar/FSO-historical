<DT>The Federation Sim Organiation was formed under the command of Fleet Admiral
Zerb and Vice Admiral Pike (Zerb is known as tsunami).Talks to form this
organization were held on Starlink-IRC. After a week of discussions and with a
staff made up of Zerb,Pike,Worf, Jovock and Beres, FSO made the decision to move
to AustNet in channel #fso. Shortly after its formation Beres left FSO to pursue
other things. Which now brings us to today, FSO now sims on Starlink in
#federation and has many sims, Star Trek and Star Wars alike to choose
from.</CENTER>
