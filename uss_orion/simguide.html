<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><H2><B>The Sim</B></H2></FONT>

When the CO is ready to Sim, he gives the word, and the crew changes their nicks for the sim. (Example: I use "Mystery5" when I'm chatting, but when I sim, I change my nick to "LtParis")<BR>
Then He or She calls for ATTENTION. This is to make sure everyone is present and ready. If you are Observing, DO NOT RESPOND.<BR>
All active simmers, reply: <FONT COLOR="#0FFFF0">::attn::</FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#0FFFF0">@@</FONT>.<BR>
After every active simmer responds, they give you a Sim Briefing in which they inform you of the mission.<BR>
After the Sim Briefing, you'll see the words "<FONT COLOR="#0FFFF0">SIM START</FONT>". When this happens, that means the sim is in progress.<BR>
Most sims last an hour, then you'll see "<FONT COLOR="#0FFFF0">SIM END</FONT>" and the CO will call for your attention.<BR>
Sometimes, they give you a little Conclusion or Epilogue to the sim.<BR>
Promotions are usually given after the conclusion, and then the CO dismisses you and you can return to your normal nickname.<BR>

Like I said, the best way to learn about Simming, is to Observe one. And the most important thing is, HAVING FUN! Don't worry if you make a mistake. Everyone makes them once in a while. If you have anymore questions, <A HREF="mailto:dsnyder66@enter.net?subject=Sim Guide">Email me</A> or go on IRC and ask them.<BR>
I hope this taught you something.
