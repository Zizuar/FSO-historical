</center><font SIZE="2">

<p>The FSO Chain of Command (CoC) is set up to help the simmers and keep stability inside
the Organization. In order for FSO to work, we need to follow this CoC as you would any
CoC of your countries army or your work for that matter. Our simmers are all considered
free with the same rights of a citizen of the United States of America. There are certain
guidelines to follow though to retain these rights. None of these guidelines are designed
to takeaway anyone&#146;s rights, there are there for the sole protection of our other
simmers and potential simmers. FSO takes pride in the uniqueness of its CoC. It equally
distributes power between different departments as well as provides you someone to always
turn to with problems inside the org. Below is a description of the Councils and staffs
along with a tree showing ranks and their position in the org.</p>

<p><u><font size="4">Description of Powers</font></u></p><p>

<font SIZE="2"></font><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><strong>Executive Command</strong></font><font SIZE="2">: The Executive Command, or EC, is responsible for all major functions of the
org. The members of the EC are the utmost important figures in FSO and guide her along the
correct path. Decisions made by the EC are final and can only be overthrown by another EC
act or by a ¾ majority complaint by the junior officers. The EC meets at least once a
month and any member may call special meetings at any time. EC members are also expected
to be present in the main channel whenever possible. The EC is headed up by the President
himself who has &quot;the final word&quot; unless all EC members disagree. (If removed by
the President, EC members retain an automatic rank of Admiral, to be reduced more a formal
Court Martial is needed.)</font></p>
<p> <font size="3" color="#00FFFF"><strong>President</strong></font><font SIZE="2">:
  The President is responsible for keeping FSO running, and may do whatever is
  in his power to keep FSO running. In order to remove a President, both the Vice
  President, 75% of the Senior Staff, and 2 Flag Staff members must agree. The
  President can overrule any decision and overrule the CoC and MRR by giving a
  Presidential Directive. By doing so however, the President leaves himself liable
  for reprimand. 3 <b><i>valid</i></b><i> </i>reprimands on 3 different issues
  in 3 months will result in the President being reviewed by the Vice President
  and JAG and could be demoted to Fleet Admiral for a period of 1 month. After
  that month, it would be decided whether or not he goes down to Admiral or returns
  to President.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#00FFFF"><strong>Vice President</strong></font><font size="2">:
  The Vice President is responsible for keeping things in order in the President's
  absense, and also acts as the President's assistant. The P and VP have to work
  quite well together as a <b>TEAM</b>. The President can change the Vice President
  through a Presidential Directive, but may not change Vice Presidents if he has
  a reprimand against him within the last month.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font SIZE="2"></font><strong><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Senior Staff</font></strong><font SIZE="2">:
  The Senior Staff compromises of every Commanding Officer. This level is higher
  than the levels of some higher ranked officers, because it is the President's
  belief that it is the CO's who need a voice more than the Admirals who do not
  serve as a CO. It is the duty of the Flag Staff to take up any concerns from
  the members of the org and discuss them with the President. They have a DIRECT
  line to the President in the Chain of Command. They write up and suggest changes
  to the MR&amp;R or CoC and help fill spots on the Committees. The Senior Staff
  serves as &quot;The peoples representatives&quot;. Meaning that other than their
  own feelings they should fight for and represent the simmers at ALL costs. The
  simmers above themselves. The Flag Staff is also the largest staff in FSO and
  may be considered the &quot;House of Reps.&quot; (besides the fact they aren&#146;t
  elected, but are kept in the staff by the simmers willing to sim on their sims,
  for if their sim gets decommissioned they are removed).The Flag Staff should
  meet at least twice a month to keep up to date with the information in the org
  and evaluate things.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font SIZE="2"></font><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><strong>Flag Staff</strong></font><font SIZE="2">:
  The Flag Staff compromises of every non-CO that has achieved a rank higher than
  Lieutenant Commander. They have the same responsibilities as the Senior Staff,
  however can not directly act as a Senior Staff member.</font></p>

<p>This concludes the current Chain of Command for the Federation Sim Organization.
  This document is subject to change or alteration at anytime by the Executive
  Command through a formal or informal amendment. Changes to the CoC will be made
  periodically to keep FSO up to date. Please check back with us. The CoC of the
  org is a system of command that also provides for more RP, yet is a serious
  matter in the organization. Please note no one will force anyone to do anything
  that is against moral standards nor if they go against religious beliefs or
  anything else in any members lives. This document is the property of FSO and
