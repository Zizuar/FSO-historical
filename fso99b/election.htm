<p><b>On September 19, 1999, President Cody Kyle Felton resigned from the office of
President.&nbsp; As a result, an election has been called for October 15-18, 1999.
&nbsp; The new president will have a life term, as Felton did.&nbsp; Each FSO member (who
has been a member for at least 1 month) is entitled to ONE vote, regardless of how many
email addresses they have or how many sims they are on.&nbsp; Votes will be accepted from
12:00pm ET Friday October 15, to 12:00pm ET Monday October 18.&nbsp; Any member of FSO who
is Lieutenant Commander or above may run, providing they are nominated by 1 FSO member
each.&nbsp; The nominations will occour in teams of 2 (eg. 2 ppl run together for Pres.
and VPres.).</p>
</b>

<p><b>The nominations are now CLOSED.</b></p>
