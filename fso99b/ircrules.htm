<p align="center">FSO IRC Channel Rules</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>The following rules are rules for all IRC Division channels, and may/may not be
enforced by the Senior Channel op (the one with highest Serv access). Once a ban longer
than 5 minutes is placed, an email must (MUST) be sent to banned@fsosim.net with a log (or
cut and paste) of the incident, and say when you want the ban lifted.</p>

<p>ONLY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS (plus the IRC Division Sub Head) MAY REMOVE BANS.
Channel Ops may ban for up to 30 MINUTES *as long as* they remove the ban within 30
minutes, and report it if its longer than 5 minutes. All bans over 30 minutes are to be
placed in Chewtoy.</p>

<p>These rules were inspired by the FSO MR&amp;R, Mission, and CoC.</p>

<p>1. Please keep swearing to an absolute non-existance.</p>

<p>3. Please refrain from flooding or spamming (more than 10 lines of text in a minute)</p>

<p>4. Please keep all argruments in private msg, or another channel (as long as the ops of
the other channel don't mind :))</p>

<p>5. #startrek is the meeting channel and may be booked for meetings. (You will be

<p>6. Bans may not be unbanned except by an EC. All bans unbanned MUST be emailed to
