<p>The Federation Sim Organizations&#146; purpose is to provide quality and fun sims to
our members. Every member has the right to sim in a peaceful and orderly environment, to
have fun, and not to be harassed. All staff and members share the responsibility of
ensuring these rights. The following rules and expectations do this, and also support the
central value of FSO, Respect - Respect for others, and self respect.  Not every rule is written down, as FSO must deal with changing issues, but any rule created shall be placed here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><u>

<p>SIMMERS</p></u></font></b><font size="2">

<p>&#133;give their sims their best effort, exercise self-discipline, accept the authority
of staff, properly attend sims, are courteous and obedient, and show respect for FSO/CO
property and sims</p>

</font><blockquote><font size="2">
  </font><font size="1"><p>Habitual neglect of duty will result in a reprimand</p>
  <p>Simmers will accept discipline from staff</p>

<u><b>

<p>INSTRUCTION COURCES</p></b></u>

<p>&#133; teaches new simmers the basics of simming different from any other. Instead of a
long and drawn out Academy, we give simmers hands on experience. Each simmer therefore
does not start out as a cadet, but as a Chief Petty Officer(CPO). After their application
is received, they will be assigned to a current experienced member who has agreed to help
train others. To train them they will observe an active sim and will explain everything,
via private messages, to the newbie also answering any questions. When the new officer
thinks he/she is ready the CO <u>MUSt</u> allow him/her to join in as a guest simmer and
have a go at a post. <b>Note:</b> Effective November 1, 1999, all COs are free to train their crew as they see fit and may not follow this rule.  If you feel you are being neglected by your CO, email <b><a href="mailto:dunk@canada.com">President Webb</a></b> or <b><a href="mailto:mj13@bigfoot.com">Executive Admiral Stark</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><u><b>

<p>DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</p></b></u>

<p>&#133;is implemented in FSO for the sole purpose of keeping order and sims fun.
Discipline is not harsh unless it is a major or repeated offense.</p>

<p><u>Reprimands</u></p>

<p>Anyone holding an Executive Officer(XO) post in a sim or above may reprimand an
officer. All a reprimand is is a filled out form discussing what happened and E-Mailed to
the President. If the President or JAG feel it is valid, it will go into their record for 3 months, for the concerned officer. The President
himself receives these reprimands and will e-mail them to the officer for his own personal
knowledge and to his/her main division head.</p>

<p><u>Banning</u></p>

<p>An officer with repeated reprimands for the same or other offense(3) may be
  banned with the approval of the Vice President for no more thsn up to 48 hours.
  The President may ban permanently only by using a Presidential Directive</p>

<p><u>Court Martials</u></p>

<p>If any officer receiving 5 or more reprimands in three months, or a serious enough offense,
  he/she may be sent for a Court Martial(CM). Penalties may include no less than
  one drop in rank up to removal from FSO if found guilty by the JAG and/or President.</p>

<p><u>Listed Offenses</u></p>

<p>Disruption of a sim, disrespecting any senior officer or other member or group,
  arguing in an FSO channel, refusal to follow orders, doing anything to violate
  another members Rights and/or responsibilities, doing anything going against
  this or any other official FSO document, being unexcused from a sim or late
  to a sim, ignoring IRC rules, etc.</p>

<p><u>Options</u></p>

<p>Any Junior officer may send in a detailed request for a reprimand of another officer to
his/her CO. The CO will decide if it is feasible or not. If found feasible the CO MUST
fill out the reprimand form. If the CO is uncooperative, then see an EC member. LAST of
all go to the President, if you go straight to the President or an EC member without
following procedure and going through to correct channels first, you will get an automatic
reprimand.</p>

<p><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b></p>

<p>&#133;the FSO MR&amp;R was created to hold the foundations of this sim group in place
and keep order and stability to the org. If there are any complaints about any part of
this please fill out the FSO Feedback form found on this site. If you are new to FSO or
considering joining, but this document has somehow frightened you off, don&#146;t worry,
we are not strict nor are we harsh or mean. As long as you follow simple guidelines as you
would in everyday life this group is a barrels of laughs and fun to be a member of. I
invite you to experience FSO first hand and become the newest member to our rapidly
growing family.</p>
<p>Jonathan Webb<br>FSO President, December 1997-March 1998, October 1999-.
