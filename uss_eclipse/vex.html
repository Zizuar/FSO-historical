Born on Earth, to parents Sharon and Phillip Grange.  Lived on Earth for 18
years, during which time he entered StarFleet academy and graduated with Top
Honors. He left Earth and had a prime role in a genetic experiment gone
wrong.  Using borg technology and Earth Genetic enhancements, Grange was
transformed into partially borgified-genetically enhanced person.  His brain
motor functions were not effected but endurance and strength as well as
speed were enhanced about 3 times the normal for a Human.  Vision and
hearing all enchanced about twice a normal human capacity. Extraoridary
components for long-life has been adapted. A Technical Vision attachment is
worn over the right-eye and some arm mechnical enhancements.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF08FF">HISTORY IN STARFLEET:</FONT><BR>
First commanded the USS Victory which was later
decommissioned after it's 10 year service.  Served on Starbase Kylon
along the Cardassian border during the Maquis engagements.  Fell in love
with a maquis captive and later helped her to escape and return to her
friends and "homeland" with the Maquis.  Reprimanded by starfleet and
placed on record.  Later met up with the Maquis associate named
Kassandra Orives. They married and she entered StarFleet academy.  After
graduating she requested a commission on the StarBase but was denied.
She was sent to USS Mekenza where she became Lt. Commander after 5 year
service.  Her first command ended up badly, as CO of USS
Benadix, during the Borg Wolf 359 encounter, her ship was destroyed.
Lieutenant Vex was then assigned to command the new Galaxy Class
StarShip Labrith but refused.<BR>
  The stress from his wife's death gave him reason to take leave on some
beautiful planet for a while. After 4 years, he was assigned to the USS Eclipse as the Chief Tactical Officer.<BR>
