Born on Earth, in Pennsylvania, in North America on May 19th of 2345. Born into a small town, the kind where everyone knows each other. He has one older brother, Thomas Paris. He immediately took interest in Astronomy, Space Travel and Exploration. After completing schooling at the age of 17, he entered Starfleet Academy.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF08FF">HISTORY IN STARFLEET:</FONT><BR>
Paris was well liked at the academy by most people because of his charming personality. But some feared that he either would turn out like his brother, or have his ability hampered by his father who is an Admiral in Starfleet.
He proved himself by graduating second in a class of 2365 and was assigned to the Defiant Class Starship, USS Valiant during her test runs. He served there as Helmsman for approximately one year. Jonathan was then assigned to the Prototype ship, USS Akira and spent 2 years aboard as the Assistant Engineer.
After his successful tour on the USS Akira, he was promoted to Lieutenant and assigned to the USS Eclipse as Chief Engineering offcier. After serving aboard for a few months, he was promoted to full Commander and began serving as Executive Officer. After Captains Granger, Rydane and Jefferys had come and gone, Paris was promoted to full captain and given command of the USS Eclipse.<BR>
