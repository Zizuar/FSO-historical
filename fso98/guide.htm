<h2><b>What Is IRC Simming?</b></h2>
</font>

<p>Simming, also known as RPGing is when a group of people get together and act out a
story. In IRC Simming, that group of people join a channel and sim there.<br>

<h2><b>The Sim</b></h2>
</font>

<p>When the CO is ready to Sim, he gives the word, and the crew changes their nicks for
the sim. (Example: I use &quot;Mystery5&quot; when I'm chatting, but when I sim, I change
my nick to &quot;LtParis&quot;)<br>
Then He or She calls for ATTENTION. This is to make sure everyone is present and ready. If
you are Observing, DO NOT RESPOND.<br>
All active simmers, reply: <font COLOR="#0FFFF0">::attn::</font> or <font COLOR="#0FFFF0">@@</font>.<br>
After every active simmer responds, they give you a Sim Briefing in which they inform you
of the mission.<br>
After the Sim Briefing, you'll see the words &quot;<font COLOR="#0FFFF0">SIM START</font>&quot;.
When this happens, that means the sim is in progress.<br>
Most sims last an hour, then you'll see &quot;<font COLOR="#0FFFF0">SIM END</font>&quot;
and the CO will call for your attention.<br>
Sometimes, they give you a little Conclusion or Epilogue to the sim.<br>
Promotions are usually given after the conclusion, and then the CO dismisses you and you
can return to your normal nickname.<br>
</p>

<p>Like I said, the best way to learn about Simming, is to Observe one. And the most
important thing is, HAVING FUN! Don't worry if you make a mistake. Everyone makes them
once in a while. If you have anymore questions, <a
HREF="mailto:@?subject=Sim Guide">Email me</a> or go on IRC and ask them.
I hope this guide has helped you, and hope to see you simming soon.</p>
