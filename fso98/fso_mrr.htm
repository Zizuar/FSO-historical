<p></font><font size="3">FSO MEMBER RIGHTS AND REGULATIONS</font></u><font size="2"></p>

<p>The Federation Sim Organizations&#146; purpose is to provide quality and fun sims to
our members. Every member has the right to sim in a peaceful and orderly environment, to
have fun, and not to be harassed. All staff and members share the responsibility of
ensuring these rights. The following rules and expectations do this, and also support the
central value of FSO, Respect - Respect for others, and self respect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u></p>

<p>SIMMERS</u></b></p>

<p>&#133;give their sims their best effort, exercise self-discipline, accept the authority
of staff, properly attend sims, are courteous and obedient, and show respect for FSO/CO
property and sims</p>

<blockquote>
  </font><font size="1"><p>Habitual neglect of duty will result in a reprimand</p>
  <p>Simmers will accept discipline from staff</p>
  <p>Orders are to be carried out immediately, unless otherwise specified</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>ATTENDANCE</b></u></p>

<p>&#133;of sims is essential for success. Constant lates/absenses are unacceptable.</p>

  your CO stating why</p>
  <p>Continued unexcused lates/absenses will result in disciplinary action</p>

  <p>Staff and Members will respect other groups</p>
  <p>All Members will respect higher ranking officers</p>
  <p></font><small><small>&nbsp;</small></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p><small><small>&nbsp;</small></small><font size="2"><u><b></p>

<p>BEHAVIOUR</b></u></p>

<p>&#133; that interferes with the rights of members and staff will NOT be tolerated.</p>

<blockquote>
  </font><font size="1"><p>Failure to cooperate will result in a repremand</p>
  <p>Profane language is NOT tolerated up to a certain extent</p>
  <p>having fun is ok, but there is a time for play and a time to be seriouse, if you cannot

<p><small><small>&nbsp;</small></small><font size="2"><u><b></p>

<p>DISCIPLINE</b></u></p>

<p>ELECTIONS</b></u></p>

<p>&#133; FSO Elections are for the office of elected officials</font><font size="1"></p>

<p></font><small><small>A term served as an elected official is ½ a year. There are 2
elected officials who will be present at all staff meetings to represent the simmers. To
run for elected official you must hold a rank of Ensign up to Commander. Elections are
held in October and March and take office in November and April.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>&nbsp;</small></small><font size="1"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><u><b></p>

<p>DEPARTMENTS</b></u></p>

<p>&#133; FSO Departments listcis here to split up the duties of officers giving everyone
a chance to make FSO work. A dept head is just that, a dept. head, no more, no less. A DH
only has command over things <u>related</u> to that department. When department decisions
are made rank holds no bounds. A DH can be anyone from the lowest Petty Officer to the
President himself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u><b></p>

<p>DIVISIONS</b></u></p>

<p>&#133; Fleets are no longer an item in FSO. We have now reverted back to divisions.
There are currently 4 divisions; IRC, Boards, E-Mail, and MU*. As stated earlier, there
are different rank for each division leader, yet each holds the same amount of power&#133;</p>

<p><u>Staff Roster</u></p>

<p>President - Felton(Blondel)</p>

<p>Commanding Admiral - Lyon(Webguy)</p>

<p>Fleet Admiral - Nurek(Baralu)</p>

<p>Executive Admiral - Phoenix(Snow)</p>

<p>Star Admiral - *UnFilled*</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u><b></p>

<p>INSTRUCTION COURCES</b></u></p>

<p>&#133; teaches new simmers the basics of simming different from any other. Instead of a
long and drawn out Academy, we give simmers hands on experience. Each simmer therefore
does not start out as a cadet, but as a Chief Petty Officer(CPO). After their application
is received, they will be assigned to a current experienced member who has agreed to help
train others. To train them they will observe an active sim and will explain everything,
via private messages, to the newbie also answering any questions. When the new officer
thinks he/she is ready the CO <u>MUSt</u> allow him/her to join in as a guest simmer and
have a go at a post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u><b></p>

<p>DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</b></u></p>

<p>&#133;is implemented in FSO for the sole purpose of keeping order and sims fun.
Discipline is not harsh unless it is a major or repeated offense.</p>

<p><u>Reprimands</u></p>

<p>Anyone holding an Executive Officer(XO) post in a sim or above may reprimand an
officer. All a reprimand is is a filled out form discussing what happened and E-Mailed to
the President. It will go into a permanent record for the concerned officer. The President
himself receives these reprimands and will e-mail them to the officer for his own personal
knowledge and to his/her main division head.</p>

<p><u>Banning</u></p>

<p>An officer with repeated reprimands for the same or other offense(3) may be banned with
the approval of 2 EC members for no more thsn up to 48 hours.</p>

<p><u>Court Marshals</u></p>

<p>If any officer receiving 5 or more reprimands, or a serious enough offense, he/she may
be sent for a Court Martial(CM). Penalties may include no less than one drop in rank up to
removal from FSO if found guilty by the JAG and board.</p>

<p><u>Listed Offenses</u></p>

<p>Disruption of a sim, disrespecting any senior officer or other member or group, arguing
in an FSO channel, refusal to follow orders, doing anything to violate another members
Rights and/or responsibilities, doing anything going against this or any other official
FSO document, being unexcused from a sim or late to a sim, etc. </p>

<p><u>Options</u></p>

<p>Any Junior officer may send in a detailed request for a reprimand of another officer to
his/her CO. The CO will decide if it is feasible or not. If found feasible the CO MUST
fill out the reprimand form. If the CO is uncooperative, then see an EC member. LAST of
all go to the President, if you go straight to the President or an EC member without
following procedure and going through to correct channels first, you will get an automatic
reprimand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u><b></p>

<p>CONCLUSION</b></u></p>

<p>&#133;the FSO MR&amp;R was created to hold the foundations of this sim group in place
and keep order and stability to the org. If there are any complaints about any part of
this please fill out the FSO Feedback form found on this site. If you are new to FSO or
considering joining, but this document has somehow frightened you off, don&#146;t worry,
we are not strict nor are we harsh or mean. As long as you follow simple guidelines as you
would in everyday life this group is a barrels of laughs and fun to be a member of. I
invite you to experience FSO first hand and become the newest member to our rapidly
growing family.</p>
