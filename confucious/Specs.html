<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT" size=6>Commander George
Meade</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT">Commander Meade served for a while
in the sim group FSG, untill leaving to form FSO with Tsunami, Jovock, Pikc,
Webguy, and a few others. After serving in FSO for a long time, he obtained the
rank of Commodore, then ran into computer problems, and was left off the
internet for some time. Upon his return, he was given his original rank back.
After that he served for another few months until FSO crashed under the weight
of Vice President Quest. Then Pike and Meade regenerated FSO, and Tsunami came
back to be President. Meade Commanded the USS Enterprise-X NCC-1701-X with a
full roster for almost a year, when it was destroyed in a battle against the
borg and romulans. </FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT">After a while, he began to dislike
how Tsunami was running the group, and decided to leave, and come back when he
wasn't president any longer. He then returned to FSO when he learned that Felton
had become President, and now sits as Commander in the ranks of FSO. </FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT">Commander Meade has commanded many
ships between all of this hustle and bustle, which makes him very experienced in
the world of Star Trek Simming.</FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT" size=6>Lieutenant Commander Jon
Sham</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face="StarTrek Film BT">Lt Commander Jon Sham has been
simming for well over a year now, close to a year and a half. He began simming
in the FSG on the ship Avenger after seeing a cool web page that had a link to
the FSG. For a couple of months, he was in the FSG only. After exploring
starlink-irc, he began simming in the SFSC, and eventually joined FSO after
Karrde asked him to join the USS Chimera. Sham simmed with the FSO then until
FSO broke broke apart. He began simming in NASC at that time. Today, Sham sims
on the Avenger in FSG, on the Chimera in NASC, and on a variety of sims in the
FSO. Sham considers himself to be very experienced with simming, as he has been
simming for a long time.</FONT></P>
