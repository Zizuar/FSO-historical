    Age: 19<br>
    Former Commander of the StarBase 297, however after going through a temporal anomoly, was trapped in the AlterVerse where he de-aged until he was 14.<p>
    With the help of Lt Cdr Jason Janson, Webb was re-aged to 19, until the shuttle could not handle any more temporal stress.  Because he was de-aged however, SFI decided to demote him.<p>[ <a
