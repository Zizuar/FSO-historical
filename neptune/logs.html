<P>Executive Officer's Log, USS Exeter June 10 2285:
<P>Today onboard the USS Exeter I heard the news I was waiting for, Captain
Thomas of the USS Neptune was stepping down and the ship was going to be
decommished. However Starfleet had considered updating the vessel for a new crew
and a mere ten minutes ago they told me I, Commander Quinn Rowe was the newest
commanding officer of the USS Neptune.
<P>I've been Executive Officer for four years now with the USS Exeter and was
shocked Starfleet would even consider me to command such a powerful
constituton-class vessel.
<P>Two minutes ago I told the Exeter crew about my command of the USS Neptune.
They were sad to see me go but proud to see that I had gotten Command. My
shuttle leaves in two minutes to report to spacedock to meet the crew of the USS
Neptune. I have already recruited my executive officer there a person by the
name of Lieutenant John Hawk........

<B>Mission 1: </B><I>"The Historian" </I>
<P>June 14, 2285:
<P>Today I arrived at spacedock to meet the crew who would be the newest USS
Neptune crew. I finally met Lieutenant John Hawk my Executive Officer face to
face and I also met some of my other officers.
<P>Before leaving I talked alittle to Captain Thomas, he wasn't too friendly so
I assume he wasn't too happy about "retiring".
<P>We entered the vessel and looked around. It was an old vessel but as
Lieutenant Hawk pointed out but still tough.
<P>As we started our first mission of patroling the neutral zone, We got a hail
from Captain Williams of Starbase 105. He told us SB105 was tracking a Romulian
vessel on apparent route to Textra IV a primitive culture. It was against the
Prime Directive to interfre with the planet.
<P>As Far as Williams knew, the planet consisted of three large countries, the
Justonian Republic, the Bathor Collective, and the small country called the
Thrawnian Dynasty.
<P>Williams feared also the fact that a historian named Heller had just landed
on the planet. He wasn't sure if the Romulians knew of this or not.
<P>After talking to us he practicaly ordered the Neptune to get involved in the
matter.
<P>I told Helm to set intercept course with Textra IV. No matter what the
situation we could not allow the Romulians to go to Textra IV. Out of nowhere
three Romulian Warbirds decloaked behind us. We tried to fight back but this
vessel wasn't in the best of shape. We took heavy hits as we tried to attack the
Warbird headed to the surface.
<P>As the Warbird entered through the atmosphere of the planet the Neptune was
in bad shape we had to do an emergency landing on the planet below.
<P>We crash landed on the surface in a large field area. Most of our sensors we
badly damaged. As the crew worked on the ship I attempted to walk outside the
ship with Epsilion the Chief Engineer to get a first hand look at the damage.
<P>As we walked down the ramp fifty natives held us with 23th Century phasers.
They then entered the ship taking the crew and forcing them outside the ship.
<P>Richard Heller the federation historan and Sylark a member of one of the
Romulian vessels greeted us. They told us of how they set up the Communist
Federation of Pangea which was a government modeled around the 20th Century
Terran USSR. Heller was the political leader while Sylark and a few other
Romulians were the military leaders. They gave them some modern devices like the
phasers.
<P>As they were about to take us away a group of no less than one hundred
appeared with guns in hand. They definately weren't CFP (Communist Federation of
Pangea). As all hell broke loose outside the ship we rushed inside the Neptune.
After sealing the door we hurried up to the bridge. The crew was able to get
some of the sensors on but we didn't have quite enough to break out of the
planet's atmosphere. We had only one chance....we had to help the freedom
fighters to get any equipment to get us off the planet. The Prime Directive had
already been grossly violated it would have made no difference if we did help
them or not. I figured since the Romulians were helping one faction it would
only be right to help the other to even out the odds.
<P>We locked our sensors on the farthest city from this point. We had to hope it
was the Justonian Republics who we thought were the ones fighting the CFP
outside the ship.
